# A Tiny Dependency Injection Container In Action
This repo is the codebase for a tiny dependency injection container.  
More advanced features like dependency scope, building a dependency graph for cycle detection, etc. is not implemented.

## How to use
- Run the projects `Main` class in one terminal. You will see the message `Application listening on port 8080`.
- Run the `Client` class. It sends a message to the main application. You should see the message `Hello from the user controller` displayed in the main application terminal.
